## Development Settings Used
Used XAMPP, created a user for MySQL with all needed priviledges
username: lenmor
- password: **********
- DB name: train

If necessary, please see php/db_connect.php, and modify the server name, username and password
to be used in the testing environment

The way i used Apache:
I put the while a4_27699727 inside htdocs, then i run apache and MySQL service
accessed home page through
localhost/a4_27699727/index.php

>dumped entire DB into a file, using Export in phpMyAdmin, saved in
>db_dump/

several dumps are generated in case one setting might not work

In case it would not work, please let me know. 
I will be willing to demo my work
using my laptop with XAMPP, if possible.
